0faaa8a3 feat(loans): add debt origination fields and UI; wire disbursement account; improve feedback and app version UI\n\n- Migration: add debt_kind, counterparty_type, counterparty_name, disbursement_account_id (FK to accounts), origination_date to loans; add indexes\n- Model: validations and associations for new fields; service object for origination data\n- Controller: permit new params; integrate DebtOriginationService\n- Views: extend loan form for counterparty + disbursement account; small polish for feedback page, app version, and user menu\n- Misc: remove obsolete lib/maybe.rb; keep backups/ out of git\n\nNotes:\n- Backfilled handling is safe; fields are optional and nullable\n- No behavior change for existing loans until edited; migration is additive\n- Tested locally with Minitest pages_controller tests and manual form submissions

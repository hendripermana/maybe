# Budget Test Suite Documentation

This document provides an overview of the comprehensive test suite created for the budget page as part of the UI/UX modernization project.

## Test Suite Overview

The budget test suite consists of four main test files:

1. **Budget Calculations Test**: Verifies the accuracy of budget calculations
2. **Budget Performance Test**: Tests performance with large numbers of budget categories
3. **Budget Accessibility Test**: Ensures accessibility compliance across all budget features
4. **Budget Interactions Test**: Tests user interactions with budget components

Additionally, a `BudgetTestHelper` module provides shared functionality across these test files.

## 1. Budget Calculations Test

### Purpose
Verify that all budget calculations are accurate and consistent across the UI and database.

### Key Test Cases
- **Budget Allocation Calculations**: Verifies that the total budgeted amount displayed matches the sum of individual category inputs
- **Budget Remaining Amount**: Ensures the remaining amount is correctly calculated and displayed
- **Progress Bar Percentage**: Confirms the progress bar accurately reflects the allocation percentage
- **Dynamic Updates**: Tests that updating a budget category correctly updates all related calculations
- **Zero Value Handling**: Verifies that the system handles zero values correctly

### Implementation Details
The test extracts numeric values from formatted text using a helper method and compares them with calculated expected values, allowing for small floating-point differences with `assert_in_delta`.

## 2. Budget Performance Test

### Purpose
Ensure the budget page remains responsive and performant even with large numbers of budget categories.

### Key Test Cases
- **Default Load Performance**: Measures page load time with the default number of categories
- **Large Dataset Performance**: Tests performance with 50 budget categories
- **Update Performance**: Measures the time to update multiple budget categories
- **Scroll Performance**: Tests scrolling performance with many categories
- **Sticky Header Updates**: Verifies that the sticky allocation progress header updates efficiently

### Implementation Details
The test dynamically creates additional budget categories as needed and measures execution time for various operations. It includes a teardown method to clean up any created categories.

## 3. Budget Accessibility Test

### Purpose
Ensure the budget page meets accessibility standards and works well with assistive technologies.

### Key Test Cases
- **Heading Structure**: Verifies proper semantic heading structure
- **Form Input Labels**: Ensures all inputs have associated labels or aria-labels
- **Color Contrast**: Checks for sufficient color contrast
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Tests keyboard-only navigation through the page
- **ARIA Attributes**: Verifies proper ARIA attributes are present
- **Screen Reader Compatibility**: Tests compatibility with screen readers
- **Axe Accessibility Audit**: Runs automated accessibility checks using axe-core

### Implementation Details
The test uses a combination of DOM inspection and JavaScript evaluation to check accessibility features. It includes a conditional axe-core audit that runs if the library is available.

## 4. Budget Interactions Test

### Purpose
Test user interactions with budget components to ensure they work as expected.

### Key Test Cases
- **Budget Category Updates**: Tests updating budget category amounts
- **Allocation Progress Updates**: Verifies the allocation progress updates when categories change
- **Confirm Button State**: Tests that the confirm button is disabled when allocations are invalid
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Tests navigating between budget categories using the keyboard
- **Touch Interactions**: Verifies touch interactions work properly on mobile devices
- **Category Group Expansion**: Tests expanding and collapsing category groups
- **Auto-Suggest Feature**: Tests the budget auto-suggest feature
- **Form Validation**: Verifies budget form validation works correctly

### Implementation Details
The test simulates user interactions using Capybara's API and verifies the expected outcomes. It includes conditional tests that skip if certain features aren't available.

## Budget Test Helper

### Purpose
Provide shared functionality for budget tests to reduce code duplication.

### Key Features
- **Test Budget Creation**: Creates a test budget with a specified number of categories
- **Amount Extraction**: Extracts numeric amounts from formatted currency strings
- **Budget Calculation Verification**: Verifies budget calculations against expected values
- **Rapid Update Simulation**: Simulates rapid updates to budget categories
- **Accessibility Checking**: Provides methods to check accessibility of budget elements

### Implementation Details
The helper is implemented as a Ruby module that can be included in test classes as needed.

## Test Coverage

The test suite provides comprehensive coverage of the budget page functionality:

- **Functional Correctness**: Ensures calculations are accurate and features work as expected
- **Performance**: Tests performance with realistic data volumes
- **Accessibility**: Verifies compliance with accessibility standards
- **User Experience**: Tests common user interactions and workflows
- **Edge Cases**: Handles zero values, invalid inputs, and other edge cases

## Running the Tests

To run the full budget test suite:

```bash
rails test test/system/budget_*_test.rb
```

To run a specific test file:

```bash
rails test test/system/budget_calculations_test.rb
```

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements to the test suite:

1. **Visual Regression Testing**: Add visual comparison tests to detect unexpected UI changes
2. **More Comprehensive Performance Testing**: Test with even larger datasets and more complex scenarios
3. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Expand testing to cover more browsers and devices
4. **User Journey Testing**: Test complete user workflows from budget creation to finalization
5. **Internationalization Testing**: Test with different currencies and number formats

# Shadcn-Inspired UI Improvements for Maybe App

## ✅ What We've Implemented (as of this session)

### 1. **Modern, Unified Cash Flow Dashboard Card**
- Sankey chart holder now uses `bg-card rounded-xl` for perfect card background and border radius match.
- All padding removed from the chart container so all sides (top, right, bottom, left) are visually balanced.
- Chart is never cut off and always fills the card area.

### 2. **Fullscreen Sankey Chart Modal**
- True fullscreen modal with `fixed inset-0 z-50 w-screen h-screen bg-black` overlay.
- Modal never flickers or closes when changing filters—chart data updates instantly via AJAX.
- Modal state is preserved across Turbo Frame updates.
- Chart container and modal header use consistent ShadCN-inspired design tokens.

### 3. **Filter Dropdown & Button Consistency**
- Filter dropdown now matches the fullscreen button in height, border, color, font, and focus state.
- Custom SVG chevron replaces browser default arrow for a modern look.
- Both controls are visually aligned and accessible.

### 4. **Performance & Maintainability**
- AJAX filter updates in fullscreen: no modal flicker, just smooth chart updates.
- All Stimulus controllers are modular and documented.
- No global hacks; all changes are opt-in and componentized.
- Follows Rails + Hotwire/Stimulus best practices for future maintainability.
- All code changes are commented for future AI/developers.

### 5. **Accessibility & UX**
- All controls are keyboard accessible and have proper focus rings.
- Visual hierarchy and spacing are consistent with ShadCN/ui design principles.

## **For Future AI/Developers**
- The Cash Flow dashboard card and fullscreen modal are now fully ShadCN-inspired and maintainable.
- If you add new filters or chart types, use the AJAX update pattern in `cashflow_filter_controller.js`.
- If you need to change the modal or chart, all logic is isolated in their respective Stimulus controllers and partials.
- For further UI polish, refer to this file and the design system tokens in `maybe-design-system.css`.

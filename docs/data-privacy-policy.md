# Data Privacy Policy for UI Monitoring and Feedback System

## Overview

This document outlines the data privacy measures implemented in the UI Monitoring and Feedback System to ensure GDPR compliance and protect user privacy.

## Data Collection

### UI Monitoring Events
- **Purpose**: Track UI errors, performance issues, and theme switching problems
- **Data Collected**:
  - Error type and message
  - Component name (if applicable)
  - Performance metrics
  - Browser information (anonymized)
  - IP address (anonymized)
  - Session ID (anonymized)
  - Timestamp

### User Feedback
- **Purpose**: Collect user feedback about UI issues and suggestions
- **Data Collected**:
  - Feedback type and message
  - Page URL
  - Browser information (anonymized)
  - Theme preference
  - User ID (if authenticated)
  - Timestamp

## Data Anonymization

### Automatic Anonymization
All collected data is automatically anonymized upon collection:

1. **IP Addresses**: Only network portion is retained (e.g., 192.168.0.0)
2. **User Agents**: Simplified to browser type only (e.g., "Chrome (anonymized)")
3. **URLs**: Query parameters and fragments are removed
4. **Personal Information**: Email addresses, phone numbers, and other PII are redacted

### Manual Anonymization
Administrators can trigger manual anonymization of existing data that may contain personal identifiers.

## Data Retention

### Retention Periods
- **UI Monitoring Events**: 90 days
- **Resolved User Feedback**: 1 year after resolution
- **Unresolved User Feedback**: 2 years

### Automated Purging
- Scheduled job runs weekly (Sundays at 2:00 AM) to purge old data
- Manual purging available through admin interface

## GDPR Rights

### Right of Access (Article 15)
Users can export their data through the `/data_privacy/export` endpoint, which provides:
- All UI monitoring events associated with their account (anonymized)
- All feedback submissions (with PII redacted)
- Data export timestamp

### Right to Erasure (Article 17)
Users can request data deletion through the `/data_privacy/delete_request` endpoint, which:
- Removes user association from monitoring events
- Anonymizes all personal data
- Maintains system insights while protecting privacy

### Right to Data Portability (Article 20)
Data export is provided in JSON format for easy portability.

## Technical Implementation

### Data Anonymization Service
The `DataPrivacyService` class handles all privacy operations:
- `anonymize_monitoring_event(event)`: Anonymizes UI monitoring data
- `anonymize_user_feedback(feedback)`: Removes PII from feedback
- `purge_old_data()`: Removes data beyond retention periods
- `export_user_data(user)`: Exports user's data in anonymized format
- `delete_user_data(user)`: Anonymizes user's data for erasure requests

### Database Design
- User associations are nullable to support anonymization
- JSONB fields store flexible event data
- Indexes support efficient querying and purging

### Background Jobs
- `DataPrivacyPurgeJob`: Automated data purging
- Scheduled via `sidekiq-cron` for regular execution

## Admin Interface

### Data Privacy Dashboard
Located at `/data_privacy/admin`, provides:
- Overview of data retention status
- Manual purging and anonymization controls
- Audit trail of privacy operations

### Audit Functionality
- Real-time audit of data retention compliance
- Identification of records needing anonymization
- Export of audit results for compliance reporting

## Security Measures

### Access Control
- Admin-only access to privacy management functions
- User authentication required for data export/deletion
- CSRF protection on all forms

### Data Protection
- Sensitive data fields are automatically identified and anonymized
- Stack traces and error details are truncated to prevent information leakage
- URL parameters that might contain sensitive data are removed

## Compliance Monitoring

### Automated Checks
- Daily monitoring of data retention compliance
- Alerts for data that exceeds retention periods
- Logging of all privacy operations

### Manual Audits
- Admin interface for compliance auditing
- Export functionality for regulatory reporting
- Documentation of all privacy measures

## Best Practices

### Development
- All new data collection must consider privacy implications
- Sensitive data should be anonymized at collection time
- Regular review of data retention policies

### Operations
- Regular monitoring of privacy compliance
- Prompt response to user privacy requests
- Documentation of all privacy-related incidents

## Contact Information

For privacy-related questions or requests, users should contact the system administrators through the feedback form or designated privacy contact channels.

## Updates

This policy is reviewed regularly and updated as needed to maintain compliance with evolving privacy regulations and best practices.

## Key Metrics and KPIs

### Error Metrics
- **Error Rate**: Errors per user session
- **Mean Time to Resolution**: Average time to fix issues
- **Error Recurrence**: How often the same errors repeat
- **Component Reliability**: Error rates by component

### Performance Metrics
- **Theme Switch Time**: Target <1 second, alert >2 seconds
- **Component Render Time**: Monitor for performance regressions
- **Page Load Performance**: Overall user experience metrics
- **Resource Usage**: Memory and CPU impact of UI operations

### User Satisfaction Metrics
- **Feedback Volume**: Number of feedback submissions
- **Feedback Sentiment**: Positive vs. negative feedback
- **Resolution Rate**: Percentage of feedback addressed
- **User Engagement**: Repeat feedback from same users

## Alert Management

### Alert Types

#### Critical Alerts
- **Multiple Similar Errors**: 3+ identical errors within 1 hour
- **Component Failures**: Critical components failing repeatedly
- **Performance Degradation**: Significant performance drops

#### Warning Alerts
- **Increased Error Rates**: Error rates above normal baseline
- **Slow Performance**: Performance metrics exceeding thresholds
- **High Feedback Volume**: Unusual increase in user complaints

### Alert Configuration

Access alert settings through the dashboard:

1. **Thresholds**: Set custom thresholds for different alert types
2. **Notification Channels**: Configure email, Slack, or other channels
3. **Alert Frequency**: Set how often alerts are sent
4. **Escalation Rules**: Define escalation paths for unresolved alerts

### Alert Response Workflow

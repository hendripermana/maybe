# Personal Lending Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the Personal Lending feature in the Permoney app to better support Indonesian Syariah-compliant lending practices and provide a more contextual user experience.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Additional Borrowing Feature

**Problem**: No way to borrow additional money from the same person without creating a new account.

**Solution**: Added "Borrow More Money" functionality.

#### Implementation:
- **Service**: `PersonalLending::AdditionalBorrowingService`
- **Routes**: `new_borrowing_personal_lending_path` and `create_borrowing_personal_lending_path`
- **UI**: Modal form accessible from account overview and activity feed

#### User Flow:
1. Go to existing personal lending account (e.g., "Borrow money from Abah")
2. Click "Borrow More Money" 
3. Fill form:
   - Amount to borrow
   - Transfer destination account (e.g., BCA)
   - Date
   - Notes (optional)
4. System creates:
   - Additional borrowing transaction (increases debt)
   - Transfer to selected bank account
   - Proper Syariah compliance tracking

### 2. Contextual Payment System

**Problem**: Users had to use generic "Transfers" menu for loan payments, losing context.

**Solution**: Added contextual payment system specific to personal lending.

#### Implementation:
- **Service**: `PersonalLending::PaymentService`
- **Enhanced**: `Transfer::Creator` for better personal lending context
- **Routes**: `new_payment_personal_lending_path` and `create_payment_personal_lending_path`
- **UI**: Contextual forms and buttons

#### User Flow:
1. Go to personal lending account
2. Click "Make Payment" (for borrowers) or "Record Payment Received" (for lenders)
3. Fill contextual form:
   - Payment amount
   - Source/destination account
   - Date
4. System creates properly categorized transfer with:
   - Correct transaction kinds (`personal_borrowing`/`personal_lending`)
   - Contextual names (e.g., "Repayment to Abah")
   - Syariah compliance notes

### 3. Enhanced User Interface

#### Account Overview Tab
- **Quick Actions section** with contextual buttons
- **Syariah compliance indicators**
- **Contextual help text** explaining each action
- **Status-aware UI** (hides actions for returned loans)

#### Activity Feed
- **Contextual dropdown menu** for personal lending accounts
- **Proper action labeling** based on lending direction:
  - Borrowers: "Borrow More Money", "Make Payment"
  - Lenders: "Lend More Money", "Record Payment Received"
- **Fallback to generic options** for edge cases

#### Transfer Names
- **Loan payments**: "Loan payment to/from Account"
- **Personal lending**: "Repayment to/from Person" or "Payment received to/from Person"
- **Syariah context**: Automatically includes compliance notes

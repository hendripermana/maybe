# User Feedback Submission Guide

## Overview

The feedback system allows you to easily report issues, suggest improvements, and share your experience with the Maybe application. Your feedback helps us continuously improve the user experience and fix problems quickly.

## How to Submit Feedback

### Accessing the Feedback Form

The feedback form is available on every page of the application:

1. **Look for the Feedback Button**: You'll find a "Feedback" button, typically located in the bottom-right corner of your screen
2. **Click to Open**: Click the button to open the feedback form
3. **Form Appears**: A feedback panel will slide out with the submission form

### Feedback Form Fields

#### Type of Feedback (Required)
Select the category that best describes your feedback:

- **Bug Report**: Something isn't working correctly
- **Feature Request**: Suggest a new feature or improvement
- **UI Feedback**: Comments about the user interface or design
- **Accessibility Issue**: Problems with accessibility features
- **Performance Issue**: The app is running slowly or having performance problems
- **General Feedback**: Any other comments or suggestions

#### Your Feedback (Required)
Describe your feedback in detail:

- **Be Specific**: Provide clear details about what you experienced
- **Include Steps**: For bugs, describe what you were doing when the issue occurred
- **Add Context**: Mention what you expected to happen vs. what actually happened
- **Suggest Solutions**: If you have ideas for improvements, include them

#### Automatic Information
The system automatically captures helpful context:

- **Current Page**: The page you're on when submitting feedback

### Example Feedback Submissions

#### Good Bug Report
```
Type: Bug Report

Message: When I try to categorize a transaction on the Transactions page, 
clicking the category dropdown doesn't show any options. I'm using the 
dark theme and this happens consistently. I expected to see a list of 
my categories to choose from.
```

#### Good Feature Request
```
Type: Feature Request

Message: It would be helpful to have a bulk edit feature for transactions. 
When I import bank data, I often need to categorize many similar 
transactions at once. A checkbox system to select multiple transactions 
and apply the same category would save a lot of time.
```

#### Good UI Feedback
```
Type: UI Feedback

Message: The account balance text is hard to read in light mode on my 
mobile device. The gray text on white background doesn't have enough 
contrast. Could you make it darker or add a background color?
```

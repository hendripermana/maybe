Welcome to the Maybe Finance user guides! These guides will help you navigate the application and make the most of its features.

## Available Guides

## About the Screenshots

The documentation includes references to screenshots that demonstrate the features in both light and dark themes. These screenshots need to be captured from the actual application and placed in the `docs/assets/images/` directory. A placeholder README file in that directory lists all the required screenshots.

**What is this about?**
Please describe what you'd like to discuss or request.

**Additional context**
Add any other context, screenshots, or information that might be helpful.

**Before submitting**
- [ ] I have searched [existing issues](https://github.com/hendripermana/permoney/issues?q=is:issue) and [discussions](https://github.com/hendripermana/permoney/discussions) to ensure this is not a duplicate
- [ ] If this is a bug report, I have used the [Bug Report" template](https://github.com/hendripermana/permoney/issues) instead
- [ ] If this is a feature request, I have checked if it's already on our [Roadmap](https://github.com/hendripermana/permoney/wiki/Roadmap) (coming soon!)

**Note about feature requests**
A feature request is functionality that you would like that is not already on our [Roadmap](https://github.com/hendripermana/permoney/wiki/Roadmap) (coming soon!).

All feature requests should be opened in a [Feature request Discussion](https://github.com/hendripermana/permoney/discussions/categories/feature-requests).

**Note about Docker hosting issues**
If you're having trouble with Docker hosting:

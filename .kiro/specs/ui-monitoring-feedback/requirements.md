# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The UI Monitoring and Feedback System aims to implement comprehensive monitoring for UI/UX issues and provide users with a structured way to submit feedback about their experience. This system will help identify UI bugs, performance issues, and theme inconsistencies while collecting valuable user feedback to guide future improvements. The system will integrate with the existing UI/UX modernization efforts to ensure a high-quality user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: UI Monitoring System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to track UI errors, performance issues, and theme switching problems, so that I can identify and fix issues before they impact many users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a UI error occurs THEN the system SHALL capture error details including component name, error message, and stack trace
2. WHEN theme switching occurs THEN the system SHALL measure and record the performance metrics
3. WHEN a component fails to render properly THEN the system SHALL log the failure with contextual information
4. IF a performance issue is detected THEN the system SHALL record metrics about the affected component and operation
5. WHEN UI monitoring events are captured THEN they SHALL be stored with user session information for troubleshooting

### Requirement 2: User Feedback Collection

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily submit feedback about UI issues or suggestions, so that I can contribute to improving the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using any page in the application THEN users SHALL have access to a feedback form
2. WHEN submitting feedback THEN users SHALL be able to categorize it (bug report, feature request, UI feedback, etc.)
3. WHEN reporting a UI issue THEN the system SHALL automatically capture contextual information (browser, theme, page)
4. IF a user is logged in THEN their feedback SHALL be associated with their account
5. WHEN feedback is submitted THEN users SHALL receive confirmation that their feedback was received

### Requirement 3: Monitoring Dashboard

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want a dashboard to view UI monitoring data and user feedback, so that I can identify patterns and prioritize fixes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the monitoring dashboard THEN administrators SHALL see summary statistics of UI errors and performance issues
2. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN administrators SHALL be able to filter events by type, component, and time period
3. WHEN examining user feedback THEN administrators SHALL be able to sort and filter by feedback type and resolution status
4. IF there are critical UI errors THEN they SHALL be highlighted prominently on the dashboard
5. WHEN viewing feedback details THEN administrators SHALL see all contextual information captured during submission

### Requirement 4: Alert System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to receive alerts for critical UI issues, so that I can address them promptly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple users experience the same UI error THEN the system SHALL trigger an alert
2. WHEN performance metrics exceed defined thresholds THEN the system SHALL notify the development team
3. WHEN theme switching failures occur THEN the system SHALL generate alerts with diagnostic information
4. IF a new type of UI error is detected THEN the system SHALL classify and prioritize it appropriately
5. WHEN alerts are generated THEN they SHALL include links to relevant monitoring data for investigation

### Requirement 5: Integration with Existing Systems

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the UI monitoring and feedback system to integrate with existing tools, so that I can maintain a unified workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UI errors are detected THEN they SHALL be compatible with the existing error tracking system
2. WHEN performance metrics are collected THEN they SHALL be viewable alongside other application metrics
3. WHEN user feedback requires action THEN it SHALL be possible to create tasks in the existing project management system
4. IF the monitoring system detects theme inconsistencies THEN it SHALL provide data compatible with the UI/UX modernization efforts
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL be able to correlate UI issues with user feedback on the same topics

### Requirement 6: Data Management and Privacy

**User Story:** As a user, I want my feedback and monitoring data to be handled responsibly, so that my privacy is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN collecting monitoring data THEN the system SHALL anonymize personal information
2. WHEN storing user feedback THEN the system SHALL comply with data protection regulations
3. WHEN displaying monitoring data THEN the system SHALL restrict access to authorized personnel only
4. IF sensitive information is accidentally captured THEN the system SHALL have mechanisms to purge it
5. WHEN retaining monitoring and feedback data THEN the system SHALL adhere to defined retention policies

# UI/UX Monitoring System Documentation

## Overview

The UI/UX Monitoring System is designed to track, log, and alert on various aspects of the user interface, including theme switching performance, component errors, accessibility issues, and user feedback. This system helps maintain a high-quality user experience by identifying problems early and providing data for continuous improvement.

## Components

### 1. Client-Side Monitoring

#### UI Monitoring Service (`app/javascript/services/ui_monitoring_service.js`)

The core JavaScript service that handles:
- Theme switching monitoring and performance metrics
- Component error detection and reporting
- Critical UI interaction logging
- Performance issue detection

#### Theme Monitor Controller (`app/javascript/controllers/theme_monitor_controller.js`)

A Stimulus controller that:
- Observes theme changes in the DOM
- Measures theme switching performance
- Reports theme-related errors

#### Component Monitor Controller (`app/javascript/controllers/component_monitor_controller.js`)

A Stimulus controller that:
- Adds error boundaries to components
- Logs critical component interactions
- Reports component-specific errors

#### Feedback Collector Controller (`app/javascript/controllers/feedback_collector_controller.js`)

A Stimulus controller that:
- Handles user feedback submission
- Captures context information (page, theme)
- Provides success/error feedback to users

### 2. Server-Side Components

#### Monitoring Controller (`app/controllers/monitoring_controller.rb`)

Rails controller that:
- Receives monitoring data from client-side
- Logs events to database and external services
- Handles user feedback submission

#### UI Monitoring Event Model (`app/models/ui_monitoring_event.rb`)

Database model that:
- Stores monitoring events (errors, performance metrics, UI events)
- Provides analysis methods for aggregating and querying data
- Supports alerting and reporting

#### User Feedback Model (`app/models/user_feedback.rb`)

Database model that:
- Stores user-submitted feedback about UI/UX
- Categorizes feedback by type (bug, accessibility, performance, etc.)
- Tracks resolution status

#### UI Monitoring Alert Job (`app/jobs/ui_monitoring_alert_job.rb`)

Background job that:
- Analyzes monitoring data periodically
- Detects patterns and regressions
- Sends alerts for significant issues
- Runs every 4 hours via sidekiq-cron

### 3. User Interface Components

#### Feedback Form Component (`app/components/feedback_form_component.rb`)

ViewComponent that:
- Provides a user-friendly feedback submission form
- Captures context information automatically
- Supports different positioning options

## Integration with External Services

### Sentry Integration

The monitoring system integrates with Sentry for error tracking:
- Client-side errors are sent to Sentry with context
- Theme information is attached to all Sentry events
- Performance issues are reported as warnings
- User information is included when available

### Skylight Integration

Performance metrics are sent to Skylight for analysis:
- Theme switching performance
- Component rendering times
- UI interaction performance

## Data Flow

1. **Event Detection**: Client-side controllers detect events (errors, interactions, theme changes)
2. **Local Processing**: UI Monitoring Service processes and enriches event data
3. **Server Transmission**: Data is sent to server endpoints in the Monitoring Controller
4. **Storage**: Events are stored in the database via UI Monitoring Event model
5. **Analysis**: UI Monitoring Alert Job analyzes data for patterns and issues
6. **Alerting**: Alerts are sent via Sentry and potentially email for significant issues

## User Feedback Flow

1. **Submission**: User submits feedback via the Feedback Form Component
2. **Processing**: Feedback Collector Controller sends data to server
3. **Storage**: Feedback is stored in the User Feedback model
4. **Analysis**: Feedback is analyzed as part of the monitoring alert job
5. **Resolution**: Administrators can mark feedback as resolved

## Monitoring Thresholds

- **Theme Switching**: Alert if average switching time exceeds 300ms
- **Component Errors**: Alert on any component errors
- **Accessibility Issues**: Alert on any accessibility feedback
- **Performance Issues**: Alert on performance regressions

## Implementation Notes

- The monitoring system is designed to have minimal performance impact
- In development mode, data is logged but not sent to external services
- Critical components can be tagged for enhanced monitoring
- The system respects user privacy by not capturing personal data

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time dashboard for monitoring data
- Machine learning for anomaly detection
- A/B testing integration
- Expanded user feedback capabilities
- Automated accessibility testing integration

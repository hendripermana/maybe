## Implementation Guidelines

### Component Replacement Strategy

For each page, follow these steps for component replacement:

1. **Identify Legacy Components**: Document all legacy components used on the page
2. **Map to Modern Equivalents**: Identify the modern component equivalents from the component library
3. **Replace Systematically**: Update templates to use modern components, preserving functionality
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify that all functionality works as expected with the new components

### Theme Integration Approach

To ensure proper theme support:

1. **Remove Hardcoded Colors**: Replace all hardcoded colors with CSS variables or Tailwind theme classes
2. **Test Theme Switching**: Verify that all components display correctly in both light and dark themes
3. **Check Contrast Ratios**: Ensure proper contrast ratios for accessibility in both themes
4. **Verify Transitions**: Ensure smooth transitions when switching themes

### Responsive Design Implementation

For responsive behavior:

1. **Mobile-First Approach**: Start with mobile layouts and enhance for larger screens
2. **Test Breakpoints**: Verify proper behavior at all defined breakpoints
3. **Touch Optimization**: Ensure proper touch targets and interactions for mobile devices
4. **Orientation Support**: Test in both portrait and landscape orientations

### Testing Strategy

For each modernized page:

1. **Functional Testing**: Verify all existing functionality works as expected
2. **Visual Regression Testing**: Compare before/after screenshots to ensure visual consistency
3. **Accessibility Testing**: Verify WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
4. **Performance Testing**: Measure and optimize loading and rendering performance
5. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Verify consistent behavior across supported browsers

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Risks and Mitigation Strategies

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| Functionality regression | Medium | High | Comprehensive testing before deployment, feature flags for gradual rollout |
| Performance degradation | Low | Medium | Performance testing with realistic data, optimization before deployment |
| User confusion from UI changes | Medium | Medium | Clear documentation, tooltips for new features, gradual rollout |
| Theme inconsistencies | Medium | Medium | Thorough theme testing, automated checks for hardcoded colors |
| Mobile compatibility issues | Medium | High | Mobile-first development approach, testing on multiple device sizes |

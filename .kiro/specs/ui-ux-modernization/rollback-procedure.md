# UI/UX Modernization Rollback Procedure

## Overview

This document outlines the procedure for rolling back the UI/UX modernization changes in case critical issues are discovered after deployment. The rollback strategy is designed to minimize disruption to users while quickly restoring stable functionality.

## Rollback Decision Criteria

### Immediate Rollback Triggers

Initiate an immediate rollback if any of these conditions are met:

1. **Critical Functionality Broken**: Core user workflows are non-functional
2. **Data Integrity Issues**: UI changes causing data corruption or loss
3. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Security issues introduced by new components
4. **Widespread Rendering Failures**: Multiple components failing to render properly
5. **Authentication/Authorization Failures**: Users unable to log in or access their data

### Delayed Rollback Triggers (Wait and Monitor)

Monitor closely but delay rollback decision if:

1. **Performance Degradation**: Significant but not catastrophic slowdowns
2. **Minor Visual Glitches**: Non-critical UI rendering issues
3. **Isolated Component Failures**: Issues limited to non-critical components
4. **Theme Inconsistencies**: Visual issues when switching themes
5. **Mobile-specific Issues**: Problems only affecting certain device types

## Rollback Types

### 1. Full Rollback

Revert all UI/UX modernization changes completely.

**When to use:**
- Critical, widespread issues affecting core functionality
- Issues that cannot be isolated to specific components
- Problems affecting a large percentage of users

### 2. Partial Rollback

Revert specific components or features while keeping other modernization changes.

**When to use:**
- Issues isolated to specific components or pages
- Problems with specific theme features
- Performance issues with particular UI elements

### 3. Feature Flag Rollback

Use feature flags to disable problematic features without code deployment.

**When to use:**
- Well-isolated issues in components behind feature flags
- Need for immediate mitigation while preparing proper fix
- Testing different solutions with subset of users

## Rollback Procedures

### Full Rollback Procedure

1. **Decision and Communication**
   - Obtain approval from project lead and engineering manager
   - Notify all team members of rollback decision
   - Create incident in tracking system

2. **Preparation**
   - Identify last stable version before UI/UX changes
   - Verify database compatibility with rollback version
   - Prepare rollback branch if not already available

3. **Execution**
   ```bash
   # 1. Switch to rollback branch
   git checkout ui-modernization-rollback
   
   # 2. Deploy to production
   ./deploy-production.sh
   
   # 3. Verify deployment
   ./verify-deployment.sh
   
   # 4. Invalidate CDN caches
   ./invalidate-cdn-cache.sh
   
   # 5. Run post-rollback verification
   ./run-verification-tests.sh
   ```

4. **Verification**
   - Verify core functionality is restored
   - Check that no new issues were introduced
   - Confirm monitoring systems are reporting normal operation

5. **Post-Rollback Actions**
   - Notify users that issues have been addressed
   - Document the rollback in incident report
   - Schedule post-mortem meeting

### Partial Rollback Procedure

1. **Identify Components to Roll Back**
   - Determine specific components causing issues
   - Create rollback patches for those components only

2. **Prepare Targeted Rollback**
   ```bash
   # 1. Create rollback branch from current production
   git checkout -b partial-rollback-$(date +%Y%m%d) production
   
   # 2. Apply component-specific rollback patches
   git apply patches/rollback-component-X.patch
   git apply patches/rollback-component-Y.patch
   
   # 3. Test changes locally and in staging
   ./run-component-tests.sh ComponentX ComponentY
   ```

3. **Deploy Partial Rollback**
   ```bash
   # Deploy to production
   ./deploy-production.sh
   
   # Invalidate specific component caches
   ./invalidate-component-cache.sh ComponentX ComponentY
   ```

4. **Verification and Monitoring**
   - Verify rolled back components are functioning correctly
   - Monitor for any interaction issues with non-rolled-back components

### Feature Flag Rollback Procedure

1. **Identify Features to Disable**
   - Determine which feature flags need to be toggled
   - Verify feature flag coverage for problematic components

2. **Execute Feature Flag Changes**
   ```ruby
   # Via Rails console or feature flag API
   FeatureFlag.disable!('modern_theme_system')
   FeatureFlag.disable!('shadcn_components')
   ```

3. **Verify and Monitor**
   - Confirm features are properly disabled
   - Monitor for any unexpected side effects

## Database Considerations

The UI/UX modernization primarily affects frontend code, but consider these database aspects:

1. **Theme Preferences**: If user theme preferences were migrated to a new format, prepare scripts to restore previous format
2. **Component Settings**: If any component settings were stored in the database, prepare migration rollback
3. **User Customizations**: Ensure any user customization data is preserved during rollback

## Asset Pipeline Considerations

1. **CSS Rollback**: Ensure old CSS files are properly deployed and cached
2. **JavaScript Rollback**: Verify correct JavaScript versions are served
3. **Image Assets**: Confirm image paths and assets are correctly restored
4. **Cache Invalidation**: Force cache invalidation for all assets

## Communication Plan

### Internal Communication

1. **Rollback Decision**
   - Notify engineering team via Slack
   - Create incident ticket with rollback details
   - Schedule immediate coordination meeting if needed

2. **During Rollback**
   - Provide regular updates in incident channel
   - Document all actions taken in incident ticket
   - Report any complications immediately

3. **Post-Rollback**
   - Send summary email to all stakeholders
   - Schedule post-mortem meeting
   - Document lessons learned

### External Communication

1. **User Notification**
   - Display banner notification about temporary issues
   - Send email for major rollbacks affecting all users
   - Update status page with current system status

2. **Support Team Communication**
   - Provide support team with issue details and talking points
   - Create FAQ for common user questions
   - Establish escalation path for critical user issues

## Post-Rollback Analysis

1. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Identify what caused the need for rollback
   - Document how issues evaded testing and QA
   - Create action items to prevent similar issues

2. **Recovery Plan**
   - Develop plan to fix issues in rolled back code
   - Create enhanced testing procedures for affected components
   - Schedule re-deployment with additional safeguards

3. **Monitoring Improvements**
   - Identify any monitoring gaps that delayed issue detection
   - Implement additional alerts for similar issues
   - Enhance logging for affected components

## Rollback Testing

To ensure rollback procedures work when needed:

1. **Regular Drills**: Practice rollback procedures quarterly
2. **Verification**: Verify rollback branches remain compatible with production
3. **Documentation**: Keep rollback documentation updated with system changes

## Appendix: Quick Reference

### Emergency Rollback Commands

```bash
# Full rollback to last stable version
git checkout ui-modernization-rollback
./deploy-production.sh --force
./invalidate-cdn-cache.sh --all

# Disable all modernization feature flags
rails runner "FeatureFlag.where(name: /modern|ui_v2|shadcn/).update_all(enabled: false)"

# Restart application servers
./restart-app-servers.sh --rolling

# Verify critical functionality
./run-smoke-tests.sh
```

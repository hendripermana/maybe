# Accessibility Audit Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive accessibility audit for the Maybe finance application, focusing on ensuring WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all components and pages. The audit will cover screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation, color contrast, and other accessibility requirements.

## Audit Scope

1. **Component-level Accessibility**
   - Test all UI components for accessibility compliance
   - Verify proper ARIA attributes and roles
   - Ensure keyboard navigability
   - Check color contrast in both light and dark themes

2. **Page-level Accessibility**
   - Test main application pages (Dashboard, Transactions, Budgets, Settings)
   - Verify proper heading hierarchy
   - Check landmark regions
   - Test page navigation and focus management

3. **Theme-specific Accessibility**
   - Test color contrast in both light and dark themes
   - Verify no hardcoded colors affecting accessibility
   - Ensure proper focus indicators in both themes

4. **Screen Reader Compatibility**
   - Test with VoiceOver (macOS)
   - Test with NVDA (Windows)
   - Verify proper announcements and navigation

## Audit Methodology

### 1. Automated Testing
- Use axe-core for automated accessibility testing
- Implement automated tests for color contrast
- Check for common accessibility issues

### 2. Manual Testing
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader testing
- Focus management testing
- Visual inspection for color contrast

### 3. Component Testing
- Test each component individually
- Verify accessibility in both themes
- Check for proper ARIA attributes

### 4. Integration Testing
- Test components in context
- Verify page-level accessibility
- Check for focus management between components

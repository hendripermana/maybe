# Accessibility Audit Report

## Overview

This report documents the findings of the comprehensive accessibility audit conducted for the Maybe finance application. The audit focused on ensuring WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all components and pages, with particular attention to screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation, color contrast, and other accessibility requirements.

## Audit Methodology

The audit was conducted using a combination of automated and manual testing techniques:

1. **Automated Testing**
   - Implemented automated tests for component accessibility
   - Used axe-core for accessibility validation
   - Created color contrast testing utilities

2. **Manual Testing**
   - Performed keyboard navigation testing
   - Conducted screen reader compatibility testing
   - Verified focus management and tab order

3. **Theme Testing**
   - Tested all components in both light and dark themes
   - Verified color contrast in both themes
   - Checked for hardcoded colors affecting accessibility

   - Status messages not using proper ARIA live regions

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Button Components

**Issues:**
- Icon-only buttons often lack accessible names
- Some buttons have insufficient color contrast in dark theme
- Focus styles sometimes inconsistent between themes

**Recommendations:**
- Add aria-label to all icon-only buttons
- Ensure all buttons use theme variables for colors
- Standardize focus styles across all button variants

### 2. Form Components

**Issues:**
- Some form fields missing explicit labels
- Error messages not always programmatically associated with inputs
- Some form controls have insufficient color contrast

**Recommendations:**
- Ensure all form fields have explicit labels or aria-label
- Use aria-describedby to associate error messages with inputs
- Review and adjust color contrast for all form controls

### 3. Modal Dialogs

**Issues:**
- Focus not always trapped within modal dialogs
- Focus not returned to trigger element when closed
- Some modals missing proper ARIA attributes

**Recommendations:**
- Implement proper focus trapping in all modals
- Return focus to trigger element when modal closes
- Ensure all modals have role="dialog" and aria-modal="true"

### 4. Navigation Components

**Issues:**
- Current page not always indicated to screen readers
- Some navigation items lack sufficient color contrast
- Keyboard navigation sometimes difficult in complex menus

**Recommendations:**
- Use aria-current for current page indication
- Review color contrast for all navigation items
- Improve keyboard navigation in dropdown menus

### 5. Data Tables and Lists

**Issues:**
- Some tables missing proper headers and associations
- Complex data relationships not always conveyed to screen readers
- Sortable columns not properly indicated

**Recommendations:**
- Use proper table markup with th and scope attributes
- Add appropriate ARIA attributes for data relationships
- Add aria-sort to sortable column headers

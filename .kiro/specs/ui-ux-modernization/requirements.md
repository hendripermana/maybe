# UI/UX Modernization Requirements

## Introduction

This project aims to modernize the Maybe finance application's UI/UX by properly integrating Shadcn components, fixing theme inconsistencies, resolving CSS conflicts, and establishing a maintainable design system. The goal is to create a cohesive, accessible, and modern user interface that works seamlessly across light/dark themes and all device sizes.

## Current State Analysis

Based on the existing documentation and codebase analysis:

### ‚úÖ What's Already Working
- **Sankey Chart Dashboard**: Fully responsive D3.js chart with modern animations and fullscreen modal
- **Design System Foundation**: Comprehensive CSS variables and theme tokens in `maybe-design-system.css`
- **Modern Components**: Some ViewComponents with ShadCN-inspired styling
- **Theme Infrastructure**: Dark/light mode support with CSS variables
- **Asset Pipeline**: Properly configured with Tailwind CSS and custom styling

### üö® Current Issues Identified
- **Dashboard Page**: Multiple UI bugs and layout issues (most problematic page)
- **Inconsistent Theme Application**: Hardcoded colors (`bg-white`, `text-black`) not respecting theme
- **CSS Conflicts**: Duplicate and conflicting rules causing layout problems
- **White Space Issues**: Extra padding/margins causing unwanted spacing
- **Incomplete Modernization**: Only dashboard partially modernized, other pages still using legacy UI
- **Component Style Leakage**: Styles affecting unintended elements
- **Overuse of `!important`**: Making maintenance difficult

### üéØ Pages Requiring Modernization
1. **Dashboard** (partially done, needs bug fixes)
2. **Transactions** (not modernized)
3. **Budgets** (not modernized) 
4. **Settings** (not modernized)
5. **All other application pages** (assessment needed)

### üåç Future Considerations (Not Current Scope)
- **Plaid Integration**: Not supported in Indonesia, needs alternative solutions
- **Stripe Payments**: Not supported in Indonesia, needs local payment providers
- **AI Services**: Expand beyond OpenAI to include Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, Kimi 2, and local LLMs
- **Exchange Rates**: Synth Finance doesn't support Indonesia, needs alternative providers

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Theme System Consistency

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to have consistent theming across all pages and components, so that my chosen theme (light/dark) is properly applied everywhere without visual inconsistencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user switches between light and dark themes THEN all components SHALL display with appropriate theme-aware colors
2. WHEN viewing any page in dark mode THEN no hardcoded light colors SHALL be visible
3. WHEN viewing any page in light mode THEN no hardcoded dark colors SHALL be visible
4. IF a component uses colors THEN it SHALL use CSS variables or Tailwind theme classes instead of hardcoded values
5. WHEN the theme is changed THEN all interactive elements (buttons, forms, modals) SHALL immediately reflect the new theme

### Requirement 2: CSS Architecture Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean and maintainable CSS architecture, so that styling changes are predictable and don't cause unintended side effects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CSS rules are defined THEN there SHALL be no duplicate or conflicting rules for the same selectors
2. WHEN component styles are written THEN they SHALL be encapsulated and not leak to other components
3. WHEN global styles are needed THEN they SHALL be clearly documented and minimal
4. IF `!important` is used THEN it SHALL be documented with a clear reason and used sparingly
5. WHEN page-specific layouts are needed THEN they SHALL use unique page classes rather than overriding global styles

### Requirement 3: Shadcn Component Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want modern, accessible UI components that follow design system principles, so that the application feels professional and is easy to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Shadcn components are used THEN they SHALL be properly configured with the application's theme system
2. WHEN custom components are needed THEN they SHALL follow Shadcn's design patterns and accessibility standards
3. WHEN existing components are replaced THEN the new components SHALL maintain all existing functionality
4. IF legacy components exist THEN they SHALL be systematically replaced with Shadcn equivalents
5. WHEN components are interactive THEN they SHALL provide appropriate feedback and states (hover, focus, disabled)

### Requirement 4: Page-Specific Integration Status

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent modern UI/UX across all pages of the application, so that my experience is uniform regardless of which feature I'm using.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the dashboard page THEN all existing UI bugs SHALL be identified and fixed
2. WHEN accessing the transactions page THEN it SHALL be updated to use the modern UI/UX components
3. WHEN using the budgets page THEN it SHALL be integrated with the new design system
4. WHEN navigating to the settings page THEN it SHALL follow the same modern UI patterns as other pages
5. IF a page has not been modernized yet THEN it SHALL be clearly identified in the implementation plan
6. WHEN pages are modernized THEN they SHALL maintain all existing functionality while improving the user experience

### Requirement 5: Layout System Standardization

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent spacing, typography, and layout patterns across all pages, so that the application feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages are displayed THEN they SHALL use consistent spacing patterns from the design system
2. WHEN special layout requirements exist THEN they SHALL be handled through page-specific classes
3. WHEN global layout changes are made THEN they SHALL not break existing page layouts
4. IF a page needs unique layout THEN it SHALL be clearly identified and documented
5. WHEN responsive design is implemented THEN all layouts SHALL work properly on mobile, tablet, and desktop

### Requirement 6: Component Documentation and Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want well-documented and tested UI components, so that I can confidently use and modify them without breaking the design system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are created or modified THEN they SHALL be documented in Lookbook
2. WHEN theme-specific overrides are used THEN they SHALL be commented with clear explanations
3. WHEN components are tested THEN they SHALL be verified in both light and dark themes
4. IF special CSS rules are needed THEN they SHALL include comments explaining their purpose
5. WHEN breaking changes are made THEN affected components SHALL be identified and updated

### Requirement 7: Performance and Maintainability

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast-loading pages with smooth interactions, so that the application feels responsive and modern.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CSS is loaded THEN it SHALL be optimized and free of unused rules
2. WHEN components render THEN they SHALL not cause layout shifts or performance issues
3. WHEN styles are organized THEN they SHALL follow a clear hierarchy and naming convention
4. IF third-party components are used THEN they SHALL be properly integrated with the theme system
5. WHEN the application loads THEN the initial theme SHALL be applied without flashing

### Requirement 8: Accessibility and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the application to be fully accessible and provide excellent user experience, so that I can use all features regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN interactive elements are used THEN they SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
2. WHEN color is used to convey information THEN it SHALL not be the only method of communication
3. WHEN focus states are displayed THEN they SHALL be clearly visible in both themes
4. IF animations are used THEN they SHALL respect user preferences for reduced motion

1. WHEN the application is viewed on different browsers THEN it SHALL display consistently
2. WHEN accessed on mobile devices THEN all functionality SHALL be available and properly sized
3. WHEN viewed on different screen sizes THEN the layout SHALL adapt appropriately
4. IF touch interactions are available THEN they SHALL work properly on touch devices
5. WHEN print styles are needed THEN they SHALL be optimized for printing

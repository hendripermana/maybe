# Budget Page Analysis

## Current Budget Display and Interaction Patterns

### Page Structure
1. **Budget Show Page** (`app/views/budgets/show.html.erb`)
   - Main budget overview with summary information
   - Two-column layout with donut chart and summary on left, categories list on right
   - Tab system for switching between "Budgeted" and "Actual" views
   - Navigation between monthly budgets

2. **Budget Categories Index** (`app/views/budget_categories/index.html.erb`)
   - Form-based interface for allocating budget amounts to categories
   - Hierarchical display of categories with parent/child relationships
   - Real-time allocation progress tracking
   - Auto-submitting forms for immediate updates

3. **Budget Category Detail** (`app/views/budget_categories/show.html.erb`)
   - Detailed view of individual category spending
   - Recent transactions for the category
   - Visual representation of budget utilization

### Key Interaction Patterns
1. **Budget Navigation**
   - Month-to-month navigation with previous/next buttons
   - Year picker for jumping to specific budget periods

2. **Budget Creation/Editing**
   - Two-step wizard flow:
     1. Set overall budget amount and expected income
     2. Allocate budget amounts to individual categories

3. **Category Budget Allocation**
   - Real-time form submission when values change
   - Visual progress bar showing allocation percentage
   - Automatic calculation of remaining amount to allocate
   - Warning indicators for over-allocation

4. **Budget Visualization**
   - Interactive donut charts for overall budget and per-category
   - Segment highlighting on hover/interaction
   - Color-coded status indicators (green for under budget, red for over)

5. **Budget Status Tracking**
   - Visual indicators for spending progress
   - Color-coded text for over/under budget status
   - Percentage-based progress indicators

## Preservation of Existing Budget Calculation Logic

### Core Calculation Logic to Preserve

1. **Budget Model Calculations** (`app/models/budget.rb`)
   - All monetized attributes and calculations
   - Period-based calculations for actual spending
   - Allocation percentage calculations
   - Available to spend/allocate calculations
   - Income estimation and tracking

2. **BudgetCategory Model Calculations** (`app/models/budget_category.rb`)
   - Category spending calculations
   - Available to spend calculations
   - Parent/child category relationships
   - Maximum allocation calculations for subcategories

3. **Visualization Data Generation**
   - Donut chart segment generation
   - Color assignments and status indicators
   - Percentage calculations for progress bars

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Keep all calculation logic in models
   - Move presentation logic to ViewComponents
   - Ensure new components call existing model methods

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Create comprehensive tests for calculation logic
   - Verify calculations remain accurate after UI updates
   - Test edge cases (over-allocation, zero budgets, etc.)

3. **Refactoring Approach**
   - Implement UI changes incrementally
   - Maintain backward compatibility during transition
   - Use feature flags if needed for gradual rollout

## Budget-Specific UI Patterns Inventory

### Visual Elements

1. **Donut Charts**
   - Overall budget utilization
   - Per-category budget utilization
   - Interactive segments with hover states
   - Center content that updates based on selected segment

2. **Progress Bars**
   - Budget allocation progress
   - Spending progress relative to budget
   - Color-coded status indicators

3. **Category Hierarchy Display**
   - Parent categories with subcategories
   - Indentation and visual connectors
   - Collapsible sections (potential enhancement)

4. **Status Indicators**
   - Color-coded text for budget status
   - Icon indicators for warnings
   - Visual feedback for over-allocation

### Interactive Patterns

1. **Auto-Submitting Forms**
   - Real-time updates when values change
   - Focus preservation after submission
   - Immediate visual feedback

2. **Budget Navigation**
   - Month/year selection
   - Previous/next navigation
   - Period picker with month/year selection

3. **Tabbed Interfaces**
   - Switching between budget views
   - Content replacement without page reload

4. **Category Selection**
   - Clicking on categories to view details
   - Drawer or modal for detailed view

### Data Visualization Patterns

1. **Summary Statistics**
   - Total budget amount
   - Allocated vs. available amounts
   - Actual vs. budgeted spending

2. **Comparative Displays**
   - Actual vs. budgeted amounts
   - Current vs. average spending
   - Month-to-month comparisons

3. **Hierarchical Data**
   - Parent/child category relationships
   - Aggregated totals at parent level
   - Detailed breakdowns at child level

## Technical Considerations

1. **JavaScript Dependencies**
   - Donut chart visualization (likely D3.js)
   - Stimulus controllers for interactive elements
   - Auto-submit form behavior

2. **CSS Challenges**
   - Consistent spacing in hierarchical displays
   - Proper alignment of form elements
   - Responsive layout for different screen sizes
   - Theme-aware color schemes for visualizations

3. **Accessibility Requirements**
   - Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
   - Screen reader support for charts and visualizations
   - Sufficient color contrast in both themes
   - Focus management for form elements

4. **Performance Considerations**
   - Efficient rendering of multiple charts
   - Optimized auto-submit behavior
   - Smooth transitions and animations

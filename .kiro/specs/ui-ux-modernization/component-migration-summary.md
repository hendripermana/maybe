# Component Migration Summary

This document provides an overview of the component migration process and how to use the provided tools to migrate from legacy components to the modern Shadcn-inspired UI component library.

## Migration Approach

The UI modernization project introduces a new component library under the `Ui` namespace that follows Shadcn design principles and provides consistent theming across light and dark modes. The migration process involves:

1. **Identifying Legacy Components**: Using the provided tools to find legacy components in the codebase
2. **Replacing Components**: Migrating from legacy components to their modern equivalents
3. **Updating Theme Variables**: Replacing hardcoded colors with theme variables
4. **Testing**: Verifying the migrated components in both light and dark themes

## Migration Tools

The following tools are provided to assist with the migration process:

### 1. Component Migration Guide

A comprehensive guide that provides detailed instructions for migrating from legacy components to their modern equivalents. The guide includes:

- General migration principles
- Component-specific migration paths
- Before/after code examples
- Theme system integration
- Troubleshooting tips

**Location**: `.kiro/specs/ui-ux-modernization/component-migration-guide.md`

### 2. Legacy Component Finder

A script that helps identify legacy components in your codebase. It scans view files for legacy component usage and reports the file paths and number of occurrences.

**Location**: `.kiro/specs/ui-ux-modernization/component-migration-scripts/find_legacy_components.rb`

**Usage**:
```bash
ruby .kiro/specs/ui-ux-modernization/component-migration-scripts/find_legacy_components.rb
```

### 3. Component Replacement Tool

A script that helps with automated replacement of simple component usages. It provides options to replace components in specific files or across the entire codebase.

**Location**: `.kiro/specs/ui-ux-modernization/component-migration-scripts/replace_legacy_components.rb`

**Usage**:
```bash
ruby .kiro/specs/ui-ux-modernization/component-migration-scripts/replace_legacy_components.rb
```

### 4. Theme Variable Finder

A script that helps identify hardcoded colors that should be replaced with theme variables. It scans files for hardcoded color classes and suggests appropriate theme variable replacements.

**Location**: `.kiro/specs/ui-ux-modernization/component-migration-scripts/theme_variable_finder.rb`

**Usage**:
```bash
ruby .kiro/specs/ui-ux-modernization/component-migration-scripts/theme_variable_finder.rb
```

## Migration Process

Follow these steps to migrate components:

1. **Preparation**:
   - Review the component migration guide to understand the migration approach
   - Ensure you have a clean working branch in your repository
   - Run the test suite to ensure everything is working before migration

2. **Component Identification**:
   - Run the Legacy Component Finder to identify legacy components in your codebase
   - Prioritize components based on usage frequency and visibility

3. **Component Migration**:
   - For simple components, use the Component Replacement Tool to automate the migration
   - For complex components, refer to the component migration guide for detailed instructions
   - Migrate one component type at a time to minimize risk

4. **Theme Variable Migration**:
   - Run the Theme Variable Finder to identify hardcoded colors
   - Replace hardcoded colors with appropriate theme variables
   - Test the application in both light and dark themes

5. **Testing**:
   - Verify the migrated components in both light and dark themes
   - Test responsive behavior across different screen sizes
   - Verify accessibility compliance
   - Run the test suite to ensure everything is working after migration

6. **Documentation**:
   - Update component documentation in Lookbook
   - Document any special considerations or edge cases
   - Share migration learnings with the team

## Best Practices

- **Incremental Migration**: Migrate one component type or page at a time
- **Commit Frequently**: Make small, focused commits for each migration step
- **Test Thoroughly**: Test in both light and dark themes after each migration
- **Review Changes**: Have team members review your migration changes
- **Document Decisions**: Document any non-standard migration decisions

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues during migration:

1. Check the component migration guide for troubleshooting tips
2. Review the component documentation in Lookbook (`/lookbook` in development)
3. Examine the component source code in `app/components/ui/`
4. Look at existing usage examples in the codebase

## Conclusion

The component migration process is a critical step in the UI/UX modernization project. By following the provided guidelines and using the migration tools, you can efficiently migrate from legacy components to the modern UI component library, ensuring a consistent and accessible user experience across the application.

## Current State Assessment

### Theme Consistency Issues

Many of the remaining pages still use hardcoded colors and styles that don't respect the theme system:

1. **Account detail pages** - Use hardcoded background colors and text colors
2. **Import workflow pages** - Contain legacy form components and styling
3. **Authentication pages** - Use older form styles and hardcoded colors
4. **Onboarding flow** - Contains custom styling that may not respect theme variables

### Component Usage Issues

1. **Legacy form components** - Many pages still use older form helpers instead of modern components
2. **Inconsistent card styling** - Account pages use various card styles that differ from the modernized components
3. **Outdated modal dialogs** - Several pages use older modal implementations
4. **Non-responsive tables** - Many data-heavy pages use tables that don't adapt well to mobile

## Prioritization Criteria

Pages have been prioritized based on the following criteria:

1. **User Usage** - How frequently users interact with the page
2. **Visibility** - How prominent the page is in the user experience

3. **Theme Integration** - Ensure proper theme variable usage
4. **Responsive Design** - Test and optimize for all screen sizes
5. **Accessibility Testing** - Verify WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
6. **Performance Optimization** - Ensure optimal loading and rendering

## Conclusion

This audit has identified approximately 50 remaining pages that need modernization. By following the prioritized rollout schedule, we can systematically update all pages while focusing first on those with the highest user impact. The implementation approach ensures consistency across the application while maintaining existing functionality.

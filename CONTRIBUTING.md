## Getting Started

Before contributing, please read our [Project Conventions Rule](https://github.com/hendripermana/permoney/blob/main/.cursor/rules/project-conventions.mdc), which is intended for LLMs, but is also an excellent primer on how we write code for Permoney.

- Before contributing, please check if it already exists in [issues](https://github.com/hendripermana/permoney/issues) or [PRs](https://github.com/hendripermana/permoney/pulls)
- If you're not sure where to start, check out our [good first issues](https://github.com/hendripermana/permoney/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)

As we are still in the early days of this project, we recommend [heading over to the Wiki](https://github.com/hendripermana/permoney/wiki) to get a better idea of _what_ to contribute.

In general, _full features_ that get us closer to [our ðŸ”œ Vision](https://github.com/hendripermana/permoney/wiki/Vision) are the most valuable contributions at this stage.
